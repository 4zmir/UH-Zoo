				<h4>  Our website is made with the administration of a zoo in mind.
				We have 6 different types of administrators: animal admin, member admin, product admin, 
				ride admin, sale admin and super admin. Even though there are multiple types of administrators,
				their actions are all fundamentally the same
				Each admin will have the ability to add, delete, and update data.
				In addition, they will also be able to display a list of the contents found in 
				their specific table and make a report based on a start and end date.</h4>

				Sale administrators will be able to create a report by date interval and one or all available products
				along with one specific salesperson or all available salespeople. Finally, product administrators 
				will be able to generate a report based on a specific date interval and either all or one specific 
				type of product.
